        <p>The <b>chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red
            junglefowl
            (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
            population of
            23.7 billion as of 2018.<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup> up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are
            more chickens in the world than
            any other bird or domesticated fowl.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
            their
            meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies,
            chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).</p>
        <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5]
            but
            with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian
            subcontinent.
            From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th
            century BC.[6] Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth
            every
            day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of
            Thutmose
            III.[7][8][9]. There are numerous cultural references to chickens, in myth, folklore and religion, in
            language
            and in literature.</p>

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks, whereas in
            the
            United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called roosters. Males less than a
            year
            old are cockerels.[10] Castrated or neutered roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical castration
            are
            now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as hens, and younger females as
            pullets,[11] although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16
            to
            20 weeks of age. The young are called chicks. In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain),
            there is
            a generic term chook /tʃʊk/ to describe all ages and both sexes.[12]

            Chicken originally referred to young domestic fowl.[13] The species as a whole was then called domestic
            fowl, or
            just fowl. This use of chicken survives in the phrase Hen and Chickens, sometimes used as a British public
            house
            or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example
            Hen
            and Chicken Islands). The hen and chickens was also a name for the pentacycle, an early design of cargo
            cycle
            which had a large central driving wheel surrounded by four small stabiliser wheels.

            In the Deep South of the United States, chickens are referred to by the slang term yardbird.[14]</p>
